### Purpose

Improbable Beef is looking for bacteria that can help flavor synthesized beef product.  Our client, Rosa, is a researcher who believes bacteria found in the human navel could be the answer.  She has collected navel-bacteria samples from participants and has asked for a dashboard that will allow participants to view their "flora" to see if they carry the bacteria species that Improbable Beef needs. 

### Deliverables
 1. Horizontal bar chart that shows the top 10 bacterial species per participant
 2. Bubble chart that shows the values and relative number of samples per species
 3. Gauge chart that shows how many times per week the individual washes their navel
 4. 3 HTML / bootstrap customizations to the dashboard

### Resources
 - Data Sources: samples.json
 - Technology: JavaScript, HTML, D3, Bootstrap3
